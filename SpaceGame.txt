Concepts for Space Game

Description:

"Aliens have invaded a space ship and our heroes have to go through a maze of
rooms defeating them so that we can escape into an escape pod to the planet
below. This is an adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die.
The game will involve an engine that runs a map full or rooms or scenes. Each
room has its own description when the player enters it and then tells the engine
which room to run to next out of the map."
